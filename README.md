# Sadykova Yasmin's Portfolio

This is the personal portfolio website of Yasmin Sadykova, an aspiring web developer. The site was built using **Bootstrap 4** for a fully responsive layout and styled with custom **CSS**.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, with elements adapting to various screen sizes using Bootstrap's grid system (`container`, `row`, `col`). On mobile devices, the layout adjusts smoothly thanks to responsive classes like `col-md-6` and `col-lg-4`.
- **Bootstrap Components**: Bootstrap's **card** components are used in the "My Hobbies" section to display hobbies in a visually appealing manner. Each card contains an image and a description.
- **Flexbox**: The `hobby-cards` section uses **Flexbox** to organize the hobby cards. The cards wrap to the next line on smaller screens and are displayed in a grid on larger screens.
- **CSS Animations**: 
  - Images in the hobbies section increase in size when hovered (`transform: scale(1.1)`), providing a subtle animation effect.
  - Links in the footer change color and get underlined when hovered, using `transition` for smooth effects.
- **Pseudo-elements**: Stars (`â˜…`) were added before section titles using the `::before` pseudo-element to give a decorative touch.
