# Sadykova Yasmin's Portfolio

This is the personal portfolio website of Yasmin Sadykova, an aspiring web developer. The site was built using **Bootstrap 4** for a fully responsive layout and styled with custom **CSS**.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, with elements adapting to various screen sizes using Bootstrap's grid system (`container`, `row`, `col`). On mobile devices, the layout adjusts smoothly thanks to responsive classes like `col-md-6` and `col-lg-4`.
- **Bootstrap Components**: Bootstrap's **card** components are used in the "My Hobbies" section to display hobbies in a visually appealing manner. Each card contains an image and a description.
- **Flexbox**: The `hobby-cards` section uses **Flexbox** to organize the hobby cards. The cards wrap to the next line on smaller screens and are displayed in a grid on larger screens.
- **CSS Animations**: 
  - Images in the hobbies section increase in size when hovered (`transform: scale(1.1)`), providing a subtle animation effect.
  - Links in the footer change color and get underlined when hovered, using `transition` for smooth effects.
- **Pseudo-elements**: Stars (`â˜…`) were added before section titles using the `::before` pseudo-element to give a decorative touch.
  
## Sections

1. **Header**: Displays the name, profession, and a short tagline.
2. **About Me**: Contains a brief biography and a profile picture.
3. **My Hobbies**: Showcases hobbies using Bootstrap cards and includes hover effects for interactivity.
4. **Interesting Facts**: A table displays interesting facts about Yasmin using Bootstrap's **table-striped** class.
5. **Contact Information**: Includes contact details and social media links styled with Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Bootstrap 4**
